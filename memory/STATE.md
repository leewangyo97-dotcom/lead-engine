# STATE — read this first, every session

**Cap: 150 lines.** When it exceeds that, roll closed items into `DECISIONS.md`
and truncate. This file is read every session; every line costs tokens repeatedly.

Last updated: 2026-09-01 · Phase: **6 — complete. Pipeline proven; funnel is dry.**

## Right now

Every path in the system has now been executed at least once against real
infrastructure, including the two that had never run.

Verified on 2026-09-01, not assumed:

- Gmail: `pnpm gmail:smoke` refreshes the token, creates a draft, reads it back
  and deletes it. Mailbox unchanged by a green run.
- The verified-only gate, on a throwaway Neon branch: a draft with a real
  contact and `verified_at = null` produced "nothing verified and unsent"; the
  same row with `verified_at` set produced a draft. Both directions, and the
  test draft and branch were deleted afterwards.

What has still never happened is a *real* draft, because no lead has cleared 75
on merit. The nearest miss is Atria at 68 — worldwide, direct contact, React —
held back only by "full-time employees only".

## Next three actions

1. **Resolve the full-time vs contract question.** PROFILE flags it as an
   unresolved inconsistency, and it is now costing leads: the contract weight is
   20 points, so a full-time-only posting cannot clear 75 however good it is.
   Answering it is a one-line rubric change, not a rewrite.
2. Run `pnpm nightly` daily. The September HN thread fills through the month.
3. Watch whether Launch HN founders keep being rejected by stage 2 (see
   DECISIONS). If the pattern holds for a fortnight, filter the domain earlier.

## Blocked

Nothing.

## Open questions for Joshua

- Public or private GitHub repo? Public = unlimited Actions minutes; private =
  2,000/month, which is still plenty. Public also means the code is visible —
  fine, since no secrets are in it, and it doubles as a portfolio piece.
- Resume says "seeking full-time remote"; the tool is built for contract. Which is it?

## Recently done

- 2026-09-01 — `remoteok` adapter added; harvest idempotent across both sources
  (30 raw, 28 unique, 0 inserted on the second run).
- 2026-09-01 — Fixed: BD titles were clearing every hard reject.
- 2026-09-01 — Phase 6: outcome logging, weekly rollup with evidence gates, the
  follow-up ladder, /review and /followups. 10 tests.
- 2026-09-01 — Gmail authorised; token exchange and drafts endpoint verified.
- 2026-09-01 — Phase 5 plumbing: model contracts, payload emitters, apply
  scripts, Gmail draft client, `pnpm tokens`. Untested against a real model.
- 2026-09-01 — Phase 4: inbox, lead detail, draft placeholder, settings.
  Keyboard triage per the UI spec: j/k/enter/e/a/x/f and the ? overlay.
- 2026-09-01 — Nightly workflow green from CI end to end.
- 2026-09-01 — Phase 3: keepalive, report-run and retention scripts; nightly
  workflow fixed to declare the monthly cron its retention job was gated on.
- 2026-09-01 — Phase 2: `disqualify.ts`, `prescore.ts`, `scripts/prefilter.ts`,
  13 tests. Exit test passes: 1 of 24 reaches `needs_scoring`.
- 2026-09-01 — Phase 1: full schema migrated, `hn-whoishiring` adapter, stack
  canonicaliser, `scripts/harvest.ts`, 10 tests. Exit test passes — second
  harvest inserts 0 rows.
- 2026-09-01 — Vercel deploy live, `/api/health` green.
- 2026-09-01 — Neon linked, first migration applied, Neon MCP registered in
  `.mcp.json`, Neon agent skills vendored into `.claude/skills/`.
- 2026-09-01 — Phase 0 skeleton: app shell, Drizzle client, migrate script,
  `runs` table for the Phase 3 keepalive, design-token layer, Vitest wired.
- 2026-09-01 — Spec written: plan, architecture, stack, data model, UI, token
  budget, features, orchestration. Agents, skills and memory bank defined.

## Reminders that bite

- Vercel Hobby cron is **once per day, ±59 min** — the scheduler is GitHub Actions
- Vercel Hobby is **non-commercial only**
- Neon autosuspends at 5 min idle and cannot be told not to; use the HTTP driver
- Phases 1–3 contain **zero** model calls. Keep it that way.
- `contentHash` stability is the single biggest cost lever — its test is not optional
